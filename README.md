## TODO

### Logic:
* A slightly different control logic diagram has been used since team two's SRS does not work with a sticky button,
it's mostly the same but we need to make sure there are not any unaccounted for states/the controller can get stuck
in bad states. 

### Control Logic Layer
* Testing

### Virtual Layer
* Testing

### Unit Testing
* Create a Unit test package and unit tests for each of the virtual and control logic components using JUnit. 
* Make sure all the components being tested execute every possible branch (i.e 100% code coverage), IntelliJ has built in features for this.
