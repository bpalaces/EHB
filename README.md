* Testing

### Virtual Layer
* Testing

### Unit Testing
* Create a Unit test package and unit tests for each of the virtual and control logic components using JUnit. 
* Make sure all the components being tested execute every possible branch (i.e 100% code coverage), IntelliJ has built in features for this.
