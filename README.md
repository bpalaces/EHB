# EHB


## TODO


### Control Logic Layer
* Use pressure profile to update pressure applied rather than just incremeting by 10% each time. 
* Testing

### Virtual Layer
* Testing

### Unit Testing
* Create a Unit test package and unit tests for each of the virtual and control logic components using JUnit. 
* Make sure all the components being tested execute every possible branch (i.e 100% code coverage), IntelliJ has built in features for this.


Here is what I think we are supposed to do in the upcomming days leading to our presentation on Thursday.

Before Saturday Morning:
* Have all the components implemented and make sure they work.
* Have all the components Unit tested? Such that they execute potential execution branches
* Give the other team all of our components except the EHB algorithm (according to kevin), and our unit tests. 

Saturday Morning - Wednesday Night:
* Implement the EHB algorithm using their components
* Test their components
* Create the presentation.
